Preparation
===========

Before coming to the tutorial, please do the following:

1. Have Python 3.6 installed in your laptop. **Note:** It's important that you're running Python 3.6 (or above) because we will use some of the new features added in 3.6 in this tutorial. 
   
   * `Here's a tutorial that will help you get set up <https://realpython.com/installing-python/>`__
   
2. Create a `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ account, if you don't already have one.
   If your account has two-factor-authentication enabled, bring that device.
   (Yubikey, your phone).

3. Create a `Heroku <https://heroku.com>`_ account. Your bot will be deployed to
   Heroku.

4. Install `Heroku Toolbelt <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install>`_.
   (Optional, it can be useful for debugging later).
