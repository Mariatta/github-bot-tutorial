Preparation
===========

Before coming to the tutorial, please do the following:

1. Create a `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ account, if you don't already have one.
   If your account has two-factor-authentication enabled, bring that device.
   (Yubikey, your phone).

2. Create a `Heroku <https://heroku.com>`_ account. Your bot will be deployed to
   Heroku.

3. Have Python 3.6 installed in your laptop. Download it `here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. **Note:** It's important that you're running Python 3.6 (or above) because we will use some of the new features added in 3.6 in this tutorial. Here are some tutorials that will help you get set up:
