Preparation
===========

Before coming to the tutorial, please do the following:

1. Have Python 3.6 installed in your laptop. **Note:** It's important that you're running Python 3.6 (or above) because we will use some of the new features added in 3.6 in this tutorial. Here are some tutorials that will help you get set up:

   - `Installing Python + Pip on Windows 10 <https://dbader.org/blog/installing-python-and-pip-on-windows-10>`__
   - `Installing Python 3.6 on Ubuntu Linux <https://askubuntu.com/questions/865554/how-do-i-install-python-3-6-using-apt-get>`__
   - On Mac OS, you should be able to download it from `python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. 
   
2. Create a `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ account, if you don't already have one.
   If your account has two-factor-authentication enabled, bring that device.
   (Yubikey, your phone).

3. Create a `Heroku <https://heroku.com>`_ account. Your bot will be deployed to
   Heroku.

4. Install `Heroku Toolbelt <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install>`_.
   (Optional, it can be useful for debugging later).
